## Adding variable labels to the columns (which would allow for a data dictionary), so that it is comprehensible for potential future users willing to use this dataset
## Some columns don't have a label as I didn't have further information on them -- should be available with Tsimane project data cleaning experts as those columns seem pertinent for data wrangling

## View data dictionary here -- can nicely see the variable description and missingness of each variable
look_for(depression_data)

## Examine missingness of pertinent variables in more detail

# 1. DepressionScore is missing for 110 observations
## seems to be missing across diverse ages, years, sex and across 38 communities
x <- depression_data %>% filter(is.na(DepressionScoreM2))
hist(x$Age)
hist(x$Year)
x %>% count(Male)
x %>% count(ComID)

# 2. Spanish Fluency is missing for 516 observations 
## missing across diverse ages and sexes, but more towards end of interview years and for 62 communities
x <- depression_data %>% filter(is.na(SpanishFluency))
hist(x$Age)
hist(x$Year)
x %>% count(Male)
x %>% count(ComID)
hist(x$DepressionScoreM2)

# 3. BMI is missing for 1226 observations (nearly half of the dataset)
## missing across interview years for both sexes across 67 communities, but a bit left skewed in terms of age, 
x <- depression_data %>% filter(is.na(BMI))
hist(x$Age)
hist(x$Year)
x %>% count(Male)
x %>% count(ComID)
hist(x$DepressionScoreM2)

# 4. Social Conflict Index is missing for 192 observations
## Missing across ages and sex, but only in 28 communities and majorly missing in the year 2006 (also slightly for more depressed people??)
x <- depression_data %>% filter(is.na(SocialConflictIndex))
hist(x$Age)
hist(x$Year)
x %>% count(Male)
x %>% count(ComID)
hist(x$DepressionScoreM2)

## 5. Subsistence Involvement Items are missing for 1226 observations (nearly half of the dataset)
## missing across interview years for both sexes across 67 communities, but a bit left skewed in terms of age,
x <- depression_data %>% filter(is.na(Diff_DepDate_and_SIDataDate))
hist(x$Age)
hist(x$Year)
x %>% count(Male)
x %>% count(ComID)
hist(x$DepressionScoreM2)

## 6. Disability Scores are missing for 2000 observations (more than half of the dataset)
## Seems more missing for younger ages, towards the later half of the interview years across 67 communities
x <- depression_data %>% filter(is.na(DisabilityScore))
hist(x$Age)
hist(x$Year)
x %>% count(Male)
x %>% count(ComID)
hist(x$DepressionScoreM2)


## 7. Household Size Data are missing for 55 observations 
## Across various ages, but towards latter half of the year across 30 communities
x <- depression_data %>% filter(is.na(household_size))
hist(x$Age)
hist(x$Year)
x %>% count(Male)
x %>% count(ComID)
hist(x$DepressionScoreM2)

## The following variables (Disability Score, BMI, all Subsistence Involvement Items) seem to be missing for nearly half/more of the dataset and doesn't seem to be missing at random
## Hence, we won't impute values for these columns and leave them out of our current analytical pipeline
## Depression sum scores also have some missing values -- these will not be imputed and shall be excluded.
## Only the predictors (Spanish Fluency, Social Conflict Index and Household size) shall be imputed.
## Implementing these changes below

## Selecting columns of analytical interest
depression_data_v2 <- depression_data %>%
  select(DepressionScoreM2, PID, FamID, ComID, region, Interviewer, InterviewDate, Age, Male, SocialConflictIndex, SpanishFluency, route_distance_town, max_community_size, household_size, DisabilityScore)

## Now exclude observations having missing depression scores
depression_data_v2 <- depression_data_v2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(DepressionScoreM2))

## Examining missingness of other variables now. 
## We have 3 observations missing FamIDs, 188 missing Social Conflict Index, 490 missing Spanish Fluency and 51 missing household_size
lookfor(depression_data_v2)

## Assigning random FamIDs to these 3 observations so that we don't lose data on family-level

## Identifying rows in the main depression dataset where FamID is missing
## 3 rows identified
na_rows <- which(is.na(depression_data_v2$FamID))

## Randomly generate 3 unique 7-digit numbers that are assigned as FamIDs
## 7-digit so that it becomes pretty obvious that these famIDs were assigned to them
random_famIDs <- sample(1000000:9999999, 3)

## Assigning these FamIDs now
depression_data_v2$FamID[na_rows] <- random_famIDs

## Worked
lookfor(depression_data_v2)

## Removing one observation below 18 years of age as Tsimane project heads remarked that this is likely due to measurement error
## After excluding this, missingness pattern changes. Remove 1 observation from patterns observed in lines 212
depression_data_v2 <- depression_data_v2 %>% 
  filter(Age > 18)


## Converting InterviewDate to POSXIct format so that standardising it using a numeric format becomes easier
depression_data_v2$InterviewDate <- as.POSIXct(depression_data_v2$InterviewDate, tz = "UTC")

## Doing some quick summary stats
## 68 communities, 10 regions, 8 interviewers, more females than males, 1803 individuals
depression_data_v2 %>% count(ComID)
depression_data_v2 %>% count(region)
depression_data_v2 %>% count(Interviewer)
hist(depression_data_v2$Age)
depression_data_v2 %>% count(Male)
depression_data_v2 %>% count(PID)

## As FamIDs can be shared between communities, we create a new column concatenating ComIDs & FamIDs so that each community has an unique FamID
depression_data_v2 <- depression_data_v2 %>% mutate(UniqueFamID = paste(ComID, FamID, sep='_'))

## Giving each individual a unique PID-FamID-ComID combination such that the same individuals across different families at different timepoints are treated as distinct
depression_data_v2 <- depression_data_v2 %>%
  mutate(PID_FAMID = paste(PID, UniqueFamID, sep = "_"))

## 1098 families/households -- 1876 individuals
depression_data_v2 %>% count(UniqueFamID)
depression_data_v2 %>% count(PID_FAMID)

## Computing correlation between age and disability score that can be reported in discussion section of main manuscript
## Vital to talk about the age effect found further in our models
cor(depression_data_v2$Age, depression_data_v2$DisabilityScore, use = "complete.obs")
